        Thanks for taking the time to suggest a performance improvement to Mocha! Please note that Mocha is a widely used library with many millions of weekly downloads, many thousands of dependents, and many years of longstanding behavior. Every change to it is inherently risky and may break user edge cases that we have no way to learn of otherwise.

        So, to suggest a performance improvement, we'd need to see _measurable, non-negligible improvement_ in Mocha's real-world usage. We can only accept changes that are demonstrably worth the risk to existing users.

        In the _Validations_ field below, please include:
        - Exhaustive comparison with other alternatives that proves this is the winning approach
        - Personal affiliation with the proposed alternatives
        - For runtime performance: some kind of reproducible benchmark to demonstrate exactly what's different
        - For dependency cleanups:
          - The specific change to the dependency tree of a project with Mocha and no other dependencies
          - The specific change to the dependency tree of a project with Mocha other common deps: maybe, chai, express, and sinon?

        That information is important because it validates that your change really does improve performance.
        For more information, see [mochajs/mocha#5377](üõ†Ô∏è Repo: Add issue template for performance improvements).
